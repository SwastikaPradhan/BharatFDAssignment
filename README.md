**FAQ Management System - Backend**

Overview
This project is a backend system to manage FAQs with support for multi-language translation, WYSIWYG editor integration, caching mechanism, and API support. It is built with Node.js and uses Express.js to create RESTful APIs for managing FAQ entries. The system integrates a WYSIWYG editor (via CKEditor) for managing rich-text answers and uses Redis to cache translations for performance improvements.
The FAQ management system allows easy storing, retrieving, and translating FAQ entries, supporting multiple languages (e.g., Hindi, Tamil) using Google Translate API for automatic translation.

Features

->Multilingual Support: FAQ questions and answers can be stored in multiple languages (e.g., Hindi, Bengali, etc.).

->WYSIWYG Editor Integration: Answers can be formatted using the CKEditor.

->Caching: Translated text is cached using Redis for better performance and faster response times.

->API Development: REST API for managing FAQs, supporting language selection via query parameter (?lang=).

->Google Translate Integration: Automatic translations are generated during FAQ object creation, with English as the fallback language.


Technologies Used
-Node.js: Backend runtime environment.
-Express.js: Web framework to build RESTful APIs.
-MongoDB: Database to store FAQ data.
-Redis: Caching mechanism to store translated text.
-Google Translate API or googletrans: For automated translation.
-CKEditor: For WYSIWYG editor support.

Caching and Performance
We use Redis to cache the FAQ translations for faster response times. Translations are cached for a specific period (e.g., 1 hour), after which they are re-translated. This minimizes the need to call the Google Translate API repeatedly.
